##10.11

###(a)

```{r}
ch10num11 <- read.csv(here::here("group-discussion-10", "Ch10Ex11.csv"), header = FALSE)

dplyr::glimpse(ch10num11)
```

###(b)

```{r}
dd <- as.dist(1 - cor(ch10num11))

plot(hclust(dd, method = "complete"))
plot(hclust(dd, method = "average"))
plot(hclust(dd, method = "single"))
```

When using linkage types "complete" and "single", we see two groups clustered. When using type "average", there are three groups clustered.

###(c)

From reading the documentation of `hclust()`, it appears that the `height` output contains values that quantify which cluster a gene belongs in based on the method used. For instance, the output of the `method = "single"` shows the gene `V19` to have the largest height, while `V22` has the lowest. I believe this tells us these two genes are at the extreme ends of each cluster and are therefore very different.
