```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggforce)
```

##(a)

```{r}
circ <- ggplot() +
  geom_circle(aes(x0 = -1, y0 = 2, r = 2)) +
  xlim(-5, 3) +
  ylim(-1, 5)

circ
```

##(b)

```{r}
circ +
  geom_text(aes(x = -1, y = 2, label = "<4")) +
  geom_text(aes(x = -4, y = 2, label = ">4"))
```

##(c)

We can see from the plot above that (-1, 1) would be classified red (inside the circle) while the other three points would be classified blue (outside of the circle)

##(d)

By expanding the equation, we see that the boundary is simply a sum of 1st and 2nd order terms of `X1` and `X2`.
