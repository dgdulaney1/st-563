```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(skimr)
```

```{r}
red_wine <- read_csv(here("final-project", "red_wine.csv")) %>% 
  # add underscore to spaces in variable names
  janitor::clean_names()
```

```{r}
skim(red_wine)
```

```{r}
red_wine %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "property") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(value, fill = property)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  facet_wrap(~property, scales = "free") +
  ggeasy::easy_remove_legend()
```

```{r}
# calculate correlations between properties and quality
cors <- red_wine %>% 
  cor() %>% 
  as.data.frame() %>% 
  rownames_to_column() %>% 
  select(rowname, quality) %>% 
  rename(cor_to_quality = quality,
         property = rowname)

# scatterplots, where facets are ordered from highest to lowest correlation with quality
red_wine %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = fixed_acidity:alcohol, names_to = "property") %>% 
  inner_join(cors, by = "property") %>%
  mutate(property = fct_reorder(property, abs(cor_to_quality), .desc = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(quality, value, color = property)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .075) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + 
  facet_wrap(~property, scales = "free") +
  ggeasy::easy_remove_legend()
```

This tell us that of the higher rated wines, `alcohol` had high values and `volatile_acidity` had low values.
